# testBackEnd
this project is made with node js 14

this is a rushed job to meet the time required and not a final product

you need a mongoDB instance to run this project 

the db configuration is inside config/default

the swagger documentaion is running on http://localhost:1337/docs

the project is running on http://localhost:1337/

i could not connect to the database provided in the challenge document so i used my local database

i deployed the project on my own server.

i will provide more details in the follow up email
